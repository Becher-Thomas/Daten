Background
PyPI does not display download statistics for a number of reasons: [1]

Inefficient to make work with a Content Distribution Network (CDN): Download statistics change constantly. Including them in project pages, which are heavily cached, would require invalidating the cache more often, and reduce the overall effectiveness of the cache.

Highly inaccurate: A number of things prevent the download counts from being accurate, some of which include:

pip’s download cache (lowers download counts)

Internal or unofficial mirrors (can both raise or lower download counts)

Packages not hosted on PyPI (for comparisons sake)

Unofficial scripts or attempts at download count inflation (raises download counts)

Known historical data quality issues (lowers download counts)

Not particularly useful: Just because a project has been downloaded a lot doesn’t mean it’s good; Similarly just because a project hasn’t been downloaded a lot doesn’t mean it’s bad!

In short, because its value is low for various reasons, and the tradeoffs required to make it work are high, it has been not an effective use of limited resources.
